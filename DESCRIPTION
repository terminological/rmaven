Description: Distributing large files in packages in contrary to CRAN policies. Java libraries frequently have large dependencies, and this makes it hard to submit to CRAN. Java has a sophisticated dependency management tool (Maven) which can calculate and cache dependencies. Running Maven from R allows for better integration of Java libraries into R. Maven provides various options for resolving complied Java code dependencies, configuring classpaths, or compiling Java source code, all of which are useful for efficient use of Java within R.
