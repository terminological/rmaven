Description: Distributing large files in packages is contrary to 'CRAN' 
    policies. Java libraries frequently have large dependencies, and this makes 
    it hard to submit to CRAN. Java has a sophisticated dependency management 
    tool (Maven) which can calculate and cache dependencies. Running Maven 
    from R allows for better integration of Java libraries into R. Maven 
    provides various options for resolving complied Java code dependencies, 
    configuring class path, or compiling Java source code, all of which are 
    useful for efficient use of Java within R.
