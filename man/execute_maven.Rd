\arguments{
\item{goal}{the goal of the \code{mvn} command ( can be multiple ) e.g. \code{c("clean","compile")}}

\item{opts}{provided options in the form \code{c("-Doption1=value2","-Doption2=value2")}}

\item{pom_path}{optional. the path to a \code{pom.xml} file for goals that need one.}

\item{quiet}{should output from maven be suppressed? (\code{-q} flag)}

\item{debug}{should output from maven be verbose? (\code{-X} flag)}

\item{verbose}{how much output from maven, one of "normal", "quiet", "debug"}

\item{require_jdk}{does the goal you are executing require a \code{JDK} (e.g. compilation does, fetching artifacts and calculating classpaths does not)}

\item{settings}{the path to a \code{settings.xml} file controlling Maven. The default is a configuration with a local repository in the \code{rmaven} cache directory (and not the Java maven repository).}

\item{...}{non-empty named parameters are passed to maven as options in the form \code{-Dname=value}}

\description{
Maven goals are defined either as lifecycle goals (e.g. "clean", "compile") or as plugin goals (e.g. "help:system"). Some Maven goals may be executed without a \code{pom.xml} file, others require one.
Some maven goals (e.g. compilation) require the use of a \code{JDK}.

\examples{
\donttest{
# This code can take quite a while to run as has to
# download a lot of plugins, especially on first run on a clean system
execute_maven("help:system")
}
