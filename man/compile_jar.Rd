\title{Compile and package Java code}
\usage{
compile_jar(
  path,
  nocache = FALSE,
  verbose = c("normal", "quiet", "debug"),
  with_dependencies = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{the path to - a source code directory containing a pom.xml file, a \code{...-src.jar} assembled by the maven assembly plugin, or a \code{pom.xml} file}

\item{nocache}{normally compilation is only performed if the input has changed. \code{nocache} forces recompilation}

\item{verbose}{how much output from maven, one of "normal", "quiet", "debug"}

\item{with_dependencies}{compile the Java code to a '...-jar-with-dependencies.jar' including transitive dependencies which is easier to embed}

\item{...}{passed to execute_maven(...), e.g. could include settings parameter}
}
\value{
the path to the compiled 'jar' file.
}
\description{
Compilation will package the Java source code in to a Jar file for further use. It will resolve dependencies and
optionally package them into a single \verb{uber jar} (using maven assembly).
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# This code can take quite a while to run as has to
# download a lot of plugins, especially on first run
path = package_jars("rmaven","src")
compile_jar(path,nocache=TRUE)
path2 = system.file("testdata/test-project",package = "rmaven")
compile_jar(path2,nocache=TRUE,with_dependencies=TRUE)
